Produce a scaling graph for the `mnist_rsvd.R` code.

*Due date:* May 18

*Optional:* Use the `rsvd()` algorithm in the `mnist_svd_cv_mpi.R` code for the basis construction. Note: while you can nest *fork* parallelization inside *MPI*, you can not nest *MPI* inside *fork*. But you can nest OpenBLAS multithreading inside ScaLAPACK's MPI.


**Notes:**

Next lecture is May 18, in-person. In the meantime, I am available for questions about the above exercise via emal at `gostrouc@utk.edu`, and will post the answers here so that everyone benefits.

**Note1**

What is a scaling graph for a parallel code? 

It shows how the run time of a code changes as we give it more cores or nodes. An example is on slide 16 of Lecture 3.
